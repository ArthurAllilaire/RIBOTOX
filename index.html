            <h3>Screening for Preeclampsia Using RNA</h3>
            <p>Pre-eclampsia is a condition prevalent around the globe that causes high blood pressure during and after
                pregnancy. Currently, It is detected after symptoms have arisen by old, antiquated methods such as a
                blood pressure
                cuff that often
                result in misdiagnosis and missed-diagnosis <sup id="cite_ref-1"><a
                        href="/Team:City_of_London_UK/Human_Practices">[1]</a></sup>,
                ultimately leading
                to
                preventable complications in pregnancy such as foetal growth restriction, low birth weight and
                life-threatening seizures
                and blood clots <sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Project RIBOTOX’s primary aim was to overcome the drawbacks of antiquated diagnostic methods, by
                developing a genetic
                engineering based cell-free test for microRNA (miRNA) biomarkers that can detect cases much sooner into
                pregnancy, so
                medication such as aspirin and statins can be taken and patients’ symptoms can be tracked by their
                doctor.</p>
            <p>The secondary aim was to create a framework with which researchers and igem teams in the future can
                develop tests for
                multiple microRNAs at low concentrations, and also to develop a software tool to increase the use of
                in-silico
                experimentation, saving costs in the lab.</p>
            <p>The final goal was to spread awareness about a condition which, despite its prevalence, is relatively
                unknown, and too
                often damages lives in both the developed and less developed worlds.</p>

            <h2>MicroRNA Biomarkers</h2>
            <p>MicroRNAs are small, 15 - 20 nucleotide long, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and play
                an important role
                in the regulation of placental development<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>.
            </p>
            <p>MicroRNAs circulating in human serum have been shown to be upregulated in certain conditions, such as
                Preeclampsia,
                allowing them to be used as biomarkers in disease detection<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a

            <p>In Preeclampsia, placental dysfunction and hypoxia leads to abnormal extracellular miRNA secretion
                and we found two
                miRNAs - miR 210 3p and miR 517 5p- which are upregulated between the 10th and 13th week of
                pregnancy, before symptoms
                have arised <sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> <sup id="cite_ref-6"><a

            <p>This is twice as early as traditional detection methods, such as a blood pressure cuff (which detects
                the condition
                after symptoms have arisen at 20 weeks), can sense the condition<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a

            <p>We designed three generations of toehold switches, improving their efficacy each time to consider
                both specificity and
                cost.</p>

                alt="Diagram of how a toehold switch works">
            <h5>Gen2</h5>
            <p>When few microRNAs are present, the ribosome binding site of an mRNA coding for luciferase is folded
                up, so the ribosome
                cannot unzip the long stem and move down the strand to the start codon to initiate translation.
                However, when a microRNA
                binds to the trigger site, the switch unfolds, decreasing the length of the stem, and exposing the
                start codon, so
                translation of leuciferase - a reporter protein - can begin. Both gen2 switches were designed using
                a Python script we
                developed which predicted the secondary structure of RNA complexes based on different linker
                regions, and selected the
                ones which were most likely to unfold.</p>

                alt="Gen 2 toehold switch">
            <h5>Gen3</h5>
            <p>After designing the gen2 switches, we realised that detecting two microRNAs using two different
                switches would require
                more hardware than if we could detect both in the same switch, and this problem would increase if we
                wanted to detect
                even more microRNAs. With this in mind, we decided to develop a novel AND-gate switch to demonstrate
                how more complex
                RNA diagnostic tools can be used to simplify other aspects of a detection kit, such as hardware.
                This switch works by binding both microRNAs together with an antiRNA and then detecting that complex
                with a
                complementary trigger binding site. It's not inconceivable that teams in the future could scale up
                our design to detect
                cocktails of 3, 4, 5 or even more microRNAs with the same toehold switch, and this is part of our
                framework for future
                research.</p>

                    href="/Team:City_of_London_UK/Design">design page</a>.</p>
            <h2>RPA</h2>
            <p>Having tested both our gen2 and gen3 switches, we decided that difficulties in discriminating between
                leaky expression,
                and low miRNA concentration, in addition to not knowing the true concentrations of the miRNAs in
                human serum meant we
                should find a way to amplify microRNAs. This decision was further confirmed by talking to
                researchers such as Dr Ciara
                O’Sullivan and Dr Alex Green.</p>
            <p>Not only is PCR difficult to perform on microRNAs due to their short length, we wanted to find a
                solution that would
                allow amplification to take place isothermally, in a single tube, increasing the accessibility of
                our tests, especially
                in countries with less access to expensive equipment such as thermocyclers. For this reason, we
                designed a new
                amplification strategy by combining Recombinase Polymerase Amplification, or ‘RPA’, with miRPA. This
                process is
                explained in detail on our <a href="/Team:City_of_London_UK/Design">design page</a>.</p>

            <h2>Outreach and Human Practices</h2>
            <p>After initially asking friends and family whether they had heard of Pre-Eclampsia, we quickly realised
                that awareness
                was not as wide-spread as it should be. Therefore, we conducted a random-sampling survey amongst our
                peers to gain an
                understanding of their knowledge of pre-eclampsia.. The results of the survey made us quickly realise
                that more
                awareness is needed on this topic.</p>
            <p>In order to combat this, we started off by making leaflets that we spread around our schools. The
                leaflets included
                information such as: symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of pre-eclampsia. To reach a wider audience,
                we recorded a
                podcast mini-series. This proved to be an effective and easily-accessible method of communication.
                We recorded episodes
                with Dr Andrew Shennan who is a professor and consultant of obstetrics at King's College London, and
                he works closely
                with APEC, which is the UKs leading preeclampsia charity. We also interviewed our head teacher Mrs
                Brown, who has
                previously had pre-eclampsia, about her experience and how it affected her.</p>
            <p>We also designed an app which provides on-hand information about pre-eclampsia for those who are keen
                to learn more. The
                app consists of details about our project, the disease and different methods in which people can
                learn more about it.</p>
            <p>In addition to this, we provided a cost model and entrepreneurship strategy which analysed how we
                could clinically
                implement our project into the real world.</p>
            <p>Throughout human practices, we have contacted numerous other teams that are taking part in the
                project as well. This
                includes King’s College London and Moscow. We also were in contact with different professors,
                charities and people from
                the iGEM ethics committee. All of these interactions helped shape our project by making sure that we
                followed all
                ethical and social guidelines, whilst effectively spreading awareness.</p>
