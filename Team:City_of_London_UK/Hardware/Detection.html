            <p>Our hardware utilises a luciferase assay to determine the result of our test. Luciferase is an enzyme
                produced by
                fireflies and other bioluminescent organisms. It produces light by acting on luciferin, a relatively
                simple compound.
                When luciferase acts on luciferin, it combines oxygen with luciferin, to produce oxyluciferin in an
                excited state. When
                the single excited electron in the oxyluciferin molecule returns to its ground state, it releases a
                photon of light of
                wavelength of approximately 550-570nm.</p>

            <p>The CDS of our toehold switches codes for luciferase, so when they are activated by the target miRNAs,
                luciferase is
                produced, which acts on the luciferin present in the solution, releasing light. We detect this released
                light using the
                arduino-based luminometer we designed. Our amplification technique, RPA, amplifies the miRNA linearly so
                the light
                released is approximately proportional to the concentration of miRNA of the blood, and the output of the
                LDR used in the
                luminometer is proportional to the irradiance. We use this to program a model that calculates the
                concentration of miRNA
                present in the blood sample and return a positive or negative result for pre-eclampsia by testing it
                against threshold
                values.</p>
