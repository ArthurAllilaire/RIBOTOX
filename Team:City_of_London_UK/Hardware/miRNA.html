        <h2 id="miRNA">miRNA extraction and amplification:</h2>
        <p>The concentration of our target miRNA in the blood is very low, making it difficult to amplify without
            prior extraction.
            Keeping in mind cost and accessibility, which are the main goals of our hardware, we quickly realised
            that we would not
            be able to use PCR for extraction, and set out to find a cheap and simple alternative.</p>
        <p>After extensive research we came across a method of miRNA extraction which utilises magnetic
            nanoparticles. Magnetic
            particles coated with bio polymers which exhibit high affinity to total RNA are commonly used to RNA
            extraction, but due
            to the small size of miRNAs, these methods are not effective at extracting miRNA, so the magnetic
            particles need to be
            specially prepared prior to use.</p>
        <p>The magnetic particles are prepared by immobilising antiRNA strands, which are complementary to the
            target miRNAs, to
            the magnetic beads. This is done by first synthesising the antiRNA strands and biotinylating them by
            binding to a
            complementary DNA template and extending by a fill-in reaction using Φ29 DNA Polymerase,the same way any
            DNA Polymerase
            extends an RNA primer in DNA synthesis, but by using biotin-11-dUTP as a substitute for dTTP. These
            biotinylated antiRNA
            strands are then immobilised to the Streptavidin magnetic beads by the strong non-covalent bond formed
            between biotin
            and Streptavidin.</p>

            class="massive-diagram">
        <p>These magnetic beads are added to the blood sample and swirled using 4 programmed electromagnets to
            increase homogeneity
            of magnetic beads concentration for more consistent and efficient binding. The target miRNA strands bind
            to the antiRNA
            strands on the magnetic beads by base pairing, thus binding to the magnetic beads. After a fixed time
            period, the
            electromagnets are switched on to pull the particles to the side of the chamber, and the rest of the
            liquid is removed.
            This process is repeated on the removed liquid 2 to 3 times to maximise the proportion of miRNA
            extracted from the
            sample.</p>
        <p>To help the toehold switches act and produce strong enough results to quantify with a luminometer, we
            decided to use
            multiple protocols in conjunction to amplify the miRNA. These methods would linearly amplify the
            concentration of miRNA
            of each sample. Due to this linear amplification, ratios of different concentrations of miRNA are
            maintained; allowing
            accurate quantification of concentration within blood. The methods we used were miRPA and Asymmetric
            RPA.</p>
        <p>The former of the methods addresses the fact that miRNA cannot be replicated by the suite of DNA
            replication enzymes. To
            do this, two DNA probes are added to the miRNA. One probe overlaps and overhangs on the 5’ end and the
            other overlaps
            and overhangs on the 3’ end. The 5’ end of the 5’ probe is phosphorylated so that it can be lighted to
            the 3’ end. From
            here, DNA ligase is added. This causes the two probes to bind together; it forms a miRNA complex with
            overhangs on both
            sides. We then add a forward primer to complement the top (overhanging) strand. DNA polymerase extends
            this primer and
            causes a dsDNA complex to be formed with the miRNA replicated within (in DNA form).</p>

            alt="Simple diagram of miRPA">
        <p>The next method then replicates the gene fragments of dsDNA formed from miRPA above. Now, forward and
            reverse primers
            are added in order to replicate the double-stranded complex. Recombinase enzymes form new complexes, on
            each side of the
            dsDNA, with both the primers. This allows the dsDNA to be opened and ‘invaded’ by the recombinases. From
            here, the dsDNA
            complex is duplicated; the cycle repeats many times to replicate and amplify the dsDNA. Importantly, we
            added an excess
            of the forward primer. Since this primer causes the miRNA-embedded strand to be replicated, the
            miRNA-embedded strand
            now becomes in excess as well. As such, this strand stays single-stranded and can therefore activate the
            toehold switch.</p>
