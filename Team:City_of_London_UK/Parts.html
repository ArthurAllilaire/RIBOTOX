            <p>Here is a list of our parts catalogue. All of our parts are designed to assist with the detection of
                miR-517 and
                miR-210, natrually occuring RNAs which are upregulated in preeclampsia patients. Our first four parts
                (BBa_K3905000-BBa_K3905003) made up our first generation toehold switch riboregulator series. These
                parts included a
                toehold switch and antiRNA for each of our target miRNAs. Based on in Silico testing, and advice from
                researchers, our
                next two basic parts (BBa_K3905004 and BBa_K3905005) made up the more efficient second series switches.
                These were
                followed by our novel AND-gate toehold switch (BBa_K3905006) which could detect both miRNAs in one
                switch with the help
                of an antiRNA (BBa_K3905007). We then made composites of our toehold switches with the reporter protein
                luciferin
                (BBa_K3905008-BBa_K3905012). Finally, our last eight basic parts make up our isothermal amplification
                system. Using
                these DNA probes we are able to increase the concentration of our target miRNAs.</p>
