            <h1 class="main-header">Proof of Concept</h1>
            <p>After designing all of our switches, the engineering process of which is detailed in our engineering
                page, and the
                design details are outlined in our design page, we were keen to get into the lab to test our single
                trigger (gen2)
                switches, and double trigger (gen3) switch, as well as our isothermal amplification method, to show
                these work well with
                our switches. If the concept was proved to work, we would, as outlined in our implementation page,
                research other miRNAs
                in our own studies to create switches with even more triggers, to create a kit to detect preeclampsia
                using a cocktail
                of miRNA triggers.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <h3>Gen2 Toehold Switches</h3>
            <p>The aim for characterising the gen2 toehold switches was to show they could discriminate between
                concentrations of miRNA
                4-fold higher, which was based on the data we gathered from research studies. This is outlined further
                in the biomarkers
                section of the design page and discriminate between similar miRNAs, or ‘homologs’, that were identified
                using our
                software tool, ‘ToeholdTools’. More information on the software tool can be found in our software page.
            </p>
            <h3>Gen3 Toehold Switches</h3>
            <p>The aim for characterising the gen3 ‘AND-gate’ toehold switch was to show it would discriminate between -
                both trigger
                miRNAs being 4-fold higher in concentration, one trigger being 4-fold higher in concentration, and
                neither trigger being
                4-fold higher in concentration.</p>
            <h3>miRPA</h3>
            <p>The goal of characterising miRPA was to show: it could discriminate between similar homologs, identified
                by
                ToeholdTools, and it would increase the concentration of our miRNAs, such that they could be detected by
                our toehold
                switch even at low concentrations.</p>

            <h2>Experimentation</h2>
            <p>In order to fulfill the goals of the toehold switches and miRPA, we had to conduct characterisation
                experiments.</p>
            <h2>Gen2 Toehold Switches</h2>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>We ordered our switches and luciferase as linear DNA with 250 random base pairs before and after the
                prefix and suffix
                respectively on the advice of our TXTL kit supplier. We first suspended our gBlocks, consisting of a T7
                promoter,
                upstream of the switch (containing an RBS), upstream of a firefly luciferase CDS, to reach an overall
                concentration of
                6.7nM in TE buffer.</p>
            <figure class="diagram-with-p hardware-figure" id="img-under">
                <img style="padding-bottom: 0px;"
                    src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/b/b6/T--City_of_London_UK--MeasureTables.txt"
                    alt="ToeHold Switch">
            </figure>
            <p>For each gen2 switch, we tested, at a constant DNA concentration, the target miRNA (miR-517-5p or
                miR-210-3p) at 9M and
                2.25M to replicate the roughly 4-fold increase of expression levels in patients with preeclampsia 1 2,
                as well as a
                homolog for each miRNA (miR-518f-5p for miR-517-5p and miR-6867-5p for miR-210-3p), which were
                determined to be the
                miRNAs have the highest probability of activating the switches aside from the target miRNAs themselves
                by our software
                tool (see software page). We then incubated the DNA, miRNAs with a plasmid containing a gene coding for
                T7 polymerase
                (to promote transcription of our toehold switch mRNAs) as well as a TXTL cell-free master mix for 1
                hour, and then
                pipetted the contents of each tube into 8 wells of a 96 well plate, and took four measurements after
                D-luciferin in a
                buffer was injected, at different times. The luciferase assay kit told us to take a measurement
                ‘immediately’ after
                injection. But we found that taking the measurement a few seconds after injection caused no luminescence
                to be detected,
                so we took measurements at later times, to analyse how luminescence changed over time.</p>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <figure class="diagram-with-p hardware-figure" id="img-under">
                <img style="padding-bottom: 0px;"
                    src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/8/8f/T--City_of_London_UK--Graph_3.png/1199px-T--City_of_London_UK--Graph_3.png"
                    alt="Toehold Switch Luciferase characterisation">
            </figure>
            <p>The results show a brief, high peak in luminescence for a high concentration of miR-210-3p. This is
                because, during the
                incubation time, more luciferase is produced due to an increased rate of translation, so there is a
                higher concentration
                of luciferase, so more luciferase-luciferin complexes form at the beginning, converting luciferin to
                oxyluciferin,
                producing luminescence. The results show that, compared to the negative control, the homolog
                ‘miR-518f-5p’ activates the
                switch more, causing an higher peak, sooner on, and there is only a small increase in luminescence
                between the control
                and the target RNA at reduced concentration.</p>
            <figure class="diagram-with-p hardware-figure" id="img-under">
                <img style="padding-bottom: 0px;"
                    src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/8/8f/T--City_of_London_UK--Graph_3.png/1199px-T--City_of_London_UK--Graph_3.png"
                    alt="Toehold Switch Luciferase characterisation">
            </figure>
            <p>The results for the miR-517-5p switch were very similar to that of the miR-210-3p switch. However, it
                showed that the
                difference in luciferase concentration after incubation was lower for the lower concentration of
                miR-517-5p than that of
                miR-210-3p. Furthermore, the homolog for this trigger miRNA, miR-518f-5p gave a higher concentration of
                luciferase than
                the homolog for miR-210-3p, suggesting that it induces translation better. This is what we would expect
                given it’s
                closer similarity.</p>
            <p>Based on these sets of data, we decided that our kit should detect luminescence at some point between 100
                and 200
                seconds.</p>

            <p>The graph on the left shows % increase in luminescence compared to the negative control (no miRNAs added)
                for the
                miR-210-3p gen2 switrch. This shows an 82% increase in expression for the target miRNA at 9M
                concentration, which drops
                to just 16% for a 2.25M concentration, showing how our toehold switch can clearly discriminate between
                these percentage
                differences in miRNA concentrations, and these concentrations are based on what we’d expect in patients
                with and without
                the condition at ten weeks 1. However, there is no data on actual concentrations of these miRNAs in the
                serum and the
                data we collected shows that if concentrations in the blood are lower than 2.25M, then an amplification
                technique would
                be necessary to discriminate between low concentrations of miRNA and leaky luciferase expression. The
                diagram on the
                right is similar to that of the miR-210-3p switch, and shows how the gen2 miR-517-5p toehold switch can
                discriminate
                clearly between miR-517-5p at 9M and 2.25M.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The gen2 toehold switches cause a noticeable increase in translation of luciferin with increased miRNA
                concentration,
                and, with software, they would be able to binarily discriminate between levels of miRNA at
                concentrations indicative of
                the condition, given they are above 2.25M in ‘normal’ patients. The results also confirmed that an
                amplification
                technique, such as miRPA, should be used in order to ensure the concentration is greater than 2.25M in
                patients without
                the condition.</p>
            <h2>Gen3 Toehold Switches</h2>
            <h3>Method</h3>
            <p>We ordered our switch and luciferase as linear DNA with 250 random base pairs before and after the prefix
                and suffix
                respectively on the advice of our TXTL kit suplier, as well as a gBlock containing our anti-miRNA under
                the control of a
                T7 promoter. We first suspended our Toehold switch, consisting of a T7 promoter, upstream of the switch
                (containing an
                RBS), upstream of a firefly luciferase CDS, and anti-miRNA gblock to reach an overall concentration of
                6.7nM in TE
                buffer.</p>
            <figure class="diagram-with-p hardware-figure" id="img-under">

            </figure>
            <p>We tested, at a constant DNA concentration, the target miRNAs (miR-517-5p and miR-210-3p) at 9M and 2.25M
                combinations
                to replicate the roughly 4-fold increase of expression levels in patients with preeclampsia 1 2. We then
                incubated the
                DNA for the switch and luciferase, the DNA for the antiRNA (aRNA) (See Design page), miRNAs with a
                plasmid containing a
                gene coding for T7 polymerase (to promote transcription of our toehold switch mRNAs) as well as a TXTL
                cell-free master
                mix for 1 hour, and then pipetted the contents of each tube into 8 wells of a 96 well plate, and took a
                measurement
                after 155s as this was in the region of high expression for high miRNA concentration samples observed in
                the single
                trigger switches.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Having tested the single trigger switches, and thereby demonstrating how our concept of a toehold switch
                works as
                hypothesised, the main purpose of testing the AND-Gate Switch was to see whether it could discriminate
                between a high
                concentration of one miRNA, and a low concentration of another, and a high concentration of both. This
                was in case a
                patient had increased levels of one miRNA and not the other, which would not be indicative of
                Preeclampsia.</p>

                    alt="Table">
            </figure>
            <p>The graphs show how, compared to the negative control, which shows leaky expression of the toehold
                switch, the
                luminescence output of the sample with 9M concentration of both miRNA triggers is 92% higher.
                Interestingly, the
                percentage increase in luminescence of the miR-210-3p at 9M and miR-517-5p at 2.25M is twice more than
                twice as high as
                the miRNAs at flipped concentrations - 28% compared to 12%. This could be because the miR-210-3p binding
                site is further
                downstream than the miR-517-5p binding site, so miR-210-3p is able to bind and partially unfold the
                switch in the
                absence of miR-517-5p, increasing the rate of translation. However, as the miR-517-5p binding site is
                further upstream,
                it is completely bound up in hydrogen bonds, so it is not accessible to the miRNA unless it binds as the
                switch is being
                transcribed.</p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>The gen3 toehold switch also causes a noticeable increase in translation when both miRNAs are at a high
                concentration
                (9M), compared to when one of both of them is at a low concentration (2.25M), which gives strong
                evidence that our
                AND-gate design works. This framework could therefore be scaled up to create more than 2 input sensing
                switches.</p>
            <h2>miRPA</h2>
            <p>Based on results from our toehold switch characterisation, we decided to find an isothermal amplification
                strategy. Read
                more about it on our <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:City_of_London_UK/Design">Design page</a>.</p>
            <p>We were supplied miRPA characterisation protocols by Dr O’Sullivan (see <a
                    href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:City_of_London_UK/Human_Practices"> Human Practices page</a>) after
                we told her about
                our project. To show that miRPA can discriminate between our miRNAs and homologous miRNAs, we tested our
                trigger miRNAs
                with their respective closest homologs, as determined by our software tool.</p>
            <p>In order to design probes for miRPA, we designed a python script using Nupack’s design functions in its
                API to find
                probes which would bind to the miRNAs, but have overhangs which didn’t bind within themselves, to ensure
                primers could
                easily anneal to them.</p>
            <p>We ordered our probes and primers on IDT and then resuspended them in a TE buffer and added them to our
                trigger and
                homologous miRNAs, with DNA ligase to bind the probes together. We amplified the miRPA product with PCR.

                discriminate
                between <100bp DNA strands, but our gel showed that the target miRNAs miR-210-3p and miR-517-5p were
                    amplified more than the homologs. Furthermore, the fact that the homologs moved further through the
                    gel suggested that the probes had not bound together, which would suggest they did not bind to the
                    homologs.</p>
                    <p>Using miRPA in our test would allow us to ensure there is an adequate miRNA concentration, and
                        our characterisation of
                        the technique showed it is specific to our miRNAs.</p>
                    <h2>Achievements</h2>
                    <p>We were able to design two generations of toehold switches which we proved to be able to
                        discriminate between the ratio
                        of concentrations typical of patients with and without preeclampsia, as well as similar, or
                        ‘homologous’ miRNAs.</p>
                    <p>We were able to design a method of amplification for our switch and proved it not only worked,
                        but could also
                        discriminate between homologous miRNAs.</p>
                    <p>We successfully designed a luminometer and extraction method, such that the concept of our test
                        as a whole is thought
                        through from start to finish.</p>
