            <p>Our kit is a multi-use rapid preeclampsia kit. With millions of people suffering from preeclampsia every
                year, it has
                come to our attention that a cheap and quick detection kit had to be made. Pre-existing detection
                methods are either
                extremely inaccurate (eg: pressure cuffs) or quite expensive and slow. Therefore, our team focused on
                increasing the
                accuracy, reducing the cost, and shortening the time required to take the test.</p>

            <h2>The aspects of our kit:</h2>
            <h3>Biology</h3>
            <p>The synthetic biology component of our kit is the most vital, and we created three generations of toehold
                switches to
                this end. To read more about our toehold switches design, go to our <a
                    href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:City_of_London_UK/Measurement">design page</a>, to learn more about
                testing them, go to
                our <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:City_of_London_UK/Measurement">measurements and results

                    alt="ToeHold Switch">
            </figure>
            <p>The toehold switch which we would use in our kit is our best, and final iteration - gen3. This toehold
                switch is an
                AND-gate switch which can detect multiple miRNA triggers by binding them together with synthetic
                anti-miRNAs to form
                larger trigger complexes. We tested this switch in the lab to show it can discriminate between a ratio
                of concentrations
                typical between patients with and without Preeclampsia. If our kit was implemented, we would conduct a
                large research
                study to find even more miRNAs upregulated in patients with Preeclampsia, and then create more than 2
                input AND gates
                based on the AND gate framework we showed works with this switch.</p>
            <p>In order to ensure patients’ serum has a concentration of miRNA high enough for us to detect the
                percentage difference,
                we have designed an isothermal amplification strategy for our miRNA triggers, involving miRPA and RPA.

                these on our <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:City_of_London_UK/Measurement">Design page</a>.</p>
            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <figure class="diagram-with-p hardware-figure" id="img-under">
                <img src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/f/fc/T--City_of_London_UK--Hardware.txt"
                    alt="Circuit Diagram">
            </figure>
            <p>On top of our wet lab, we extensively researched methods to measure luciferase output from our designed
                circuits.</p>
            <p>We designed a magnetic bead-based miRNA extraction system, which could be further developed to be used in
                clinical
                trials to improve specificity and accuracy of our extraction system. In addition, we developed and
                assembled a
                luminometer circuit, which measures luminescence to return a positive or negative result. If our
                hardware was to be
                implemented, this luminometer design can be adapted to rollout a low-cost, high-specificity luminometer.
            </p>
            <h2>Stages of kit implementation</h2>
            <p>For a extensive rollout of our proposed detection kits, the following stages of work would have to be
                completed:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Fundraising and project proposal
                    <ul class="lettered-list">
                        <li>For mass production and professional research, sums in the millions of pounds would be
                            required. In order to achieve
                            this fundraising requirement, attracting investment through project proposals is key.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Research
                    <ul class="lettered-list">
                        <li>We can use the AND gate framework to create multi-input toehold switches which detect a much
                            larger array of miRNAs for
                            higher specificity.</li>
                        <li>More research in order to reduce false results, minimise errors, and maximise specificity is
                            required.</li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Designing toehold switches and probes for miRPA using our software tools and the general project
                    framework
                    <ul class="lettered-list">
                        <li>Once preliminary research is completed, the first phase of designing the kit begins.</li>
                        <li>Once AND gate toehold switch and miRNA probes are designed, the kit is ready to be tested.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Trials, both clinical and non-clinical

                        <li>In vitro testing, human testing would be required. One advantage of our product is that our
                            kit has no side effects bar
                            collecting a small sample of blood from the tested individual. This will, therefore, reduce
                            time and cost for clinical
                            trials compared to many other medical equipment.</li>

                    <ul class="lettered-list">
                        <li>After completing testing, our kit has to be sold and distributed to pregnancy clinics,
                            hospitals, national healthcare
                            services, and governmental bodies.</li>

            <h2>SWOT Analysis:</h2>
            <p>To carefully judge the pros and cons of our kit, we created a SWOT analysis table.</p>
            <h3>Strengths</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Requires little equipment bar our kit, and highly cost effective, even when rolled out in large
                    numbers (See <a href="https://2021.igem.org/Team:City_of_London_UK/Model#Cost_model">Cost Model</a>
                    under Modelling)</li>
                <li>Diagnosis in under one hour</li>
                <li>Pre-Eclampsia product new to market</li>
                <li>Serum sample is easy to obtain</li>
                <li>Small current market for blood-test- based Preeclampsia detection</li>
                <li>Innovative use of AND-gate toehold switches to prevent ‘leakiness’ and false positives and increase
                    accuracy</li>
                <li>Preeclampsia test market estimated to be $1.1 billion by 2027 <sup id="cite_ref-1"><a
                            href="cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Weaknesses</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Absence of creation of large-scale production</li>
                <li>Solutions for the test require containment in dry ice</li>
                <li>Hardware requires an energy source from either batteries or an outlet plug, making it hard to
                    implement in
                    under-developed areas</li>
                <li>Lack of copyright for our test</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Opportunities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Currently no other blood test for Pre-Eclampsia</li>
                <li>Half the price of screening during first and second trimester</li>
                <li>A third of the price of combined early-onset and first trimester screening</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Threats</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>VCGS offers a screening process for first trimester, second trimester, and early-onset preeclampsia
                </li>
                <li>Negative perceptions of genetic engineering from the public</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Customer discovery:</h2>
            <p>Focusing on the different levels of customers that will purchase our kit, we looked at a total of 4
                different stages.</p>
            <p>From the distributor (us or a manufacturing company):</p>
            <h3>Customer Level 1:</h6>
                <p>Governments and NHS: The National Health Service is the publicly funded healthcare system in England,
                    and
                    received a
                    budget of £134 billion in 2019. Furthermore, the NHS delivered 591,759 babies in 2019. Our product
                    would
                    be used by all
                    the expecting mothers who are treated by the NHS to ensure early and reliable diagnosis of
                    pre-eclampsia.</p>
                <p>National healthcare systems would purchase the preeclampsia tests for use on expecting mothers in
                    their
                    care.</p>
                <h3>Customer Level 1.5:</h6>
                    <p>Pharmaceutical TNCs (eg Bayer, GSK)/Chain private-clinics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>National healthcare systems would purchase the preeclampsia tests for use on expecting
                            mothers in
                            their care.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Customer Level 2:</h6>
                        <p>Pharmacies/ Supermarkets:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pharmacies and Supermarkets would purchase the tests to resell them to their customers
                                that are
                                pregnant and want to
                                test for preeclampsia.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Customer level 3: The Ultimate benefitter</h6>
                            <p>The ultimate benefitter would be the mother who is being tested and her unborn baby as
                                this test would
                                indicate whether
                                treatment is needed and maybe whether an early delivery is needed.</p>

                                alt="Pyramid">
                            <h2>Similar products:</h2>
                            <p>To find competitors in our market, we first looked at similar disease detection methods.
                                Then we found one main
                                competitor, a company who focuses on preeclampsia detection specifically. This
                                competitor, VCGS, provides testing for
                                first and second trimester screening along with early-onset preeclampsia tests. For the
                                first and second trimester
                                tests, the price ranges from $79 to $101. In this case our cost is below the lowest
                                bound which provides a strong
                                incentive to buy from us instead of from VCGS. The early-onset tests (combined with
                                first trimester testing) range in
                                price from $111 to $120. Our product does not directly compete with the early-onset
                                testing services, however, that we
                                are once again below the lower bound of cost is a good sign of our relative price
                                competitiveness. All other competition
                                is not directly against us as all other competitors’ products revolve around placental
                                growth - not a diagnostic blood
                                test like ours. This gives us a smaller and more penetrable market.</p>
                            <p>Other similar products include Rapid Antigen Tests for travel, PCR tests for COVID-19,
                                and Blood Type testing kits. The
                                rapid antigen tests cost £29 and thus are slightly more cost efficient than our product.
                                However, this price difference
                                is only slight and all of our test is single-use (unlike the RATs), furthermore they
                                test for an entirely different
                                disease. More accurate testing for COVID-19, and another competitor, is by using PCR.
                                These tests cost £79 which makes
                                our test a considerably cheaper technology. Whilst we do not directly compete, since
                                they test for different diseases,
                                this is further evidence for our price being a compelling one. The Blood Type Test Kit
                                is much cheaper than our kit at
                                £7.25. This cost difference can be largely attributed to the difference in hardware
                                pricing. This suggests that our
                                product is not at the cheapest price that could be achievable. However, cost often
                                reduces greatly when mass production
                                is used - due to economies of scale. As such, the price delta is not an issue.</p>

                                        <li>VCGS is the only direct competitor regarding pre-eclampsia, the other ones
                                            relate to placental growth. Smaller market
                                            means our product has a greater chance of breaking through and becoming
                                            commonly utilised.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <h3>Will governments bulk purchase our kits?</h3>
                            <p>Our kits will replace alternative screening products which currently cost over twice the
                                amount of ours. This provides a
                                cheaper alternative for national health services which are already at their limit of
                                funding, thus providing a strong
                                incentive for governments to bulk purchase our kits. A potential issue could be the
                                requirement for dry-ice shipping and
                                storage. However, through the COVID vaccine rollout, we have seen that healthcare
                                providers have the necessary equipment
                                and capacity to keep a bulk set of tests (namely the Pfizer-BioNTech, and the Moderna
                                vaccines) at less than -15 degrees
                                celsius. The EU, for example, bulk purchased over 900 million Pfizer-BioNTech
                                vaccines<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> - each which has to be
                                stored at -70 degrees Celsius. Therefore, it is clear that the storage requirements
                                would not negatively impact the
                                chance of governments bulk purchasing our kits. The EU also bought 500 million COVID-19
                                vaccine does at a cost of
                                £1.75 billion. Conservatively estimating the cost of a single test to be £30, the bloc
                                could purchase 58 million of
                                our tests for the same price. This single level of investment, extrapolating from the
                                number of births in the EU in
                                2019 (4.2 million)<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>,
                                would provide enough tests for screening of pregnant women for 13.8 years. Preeclampsia
                                is also associated with
                                30% of overall obstetrics costs<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
                                and thus, by buying our product and implementing screening, the
                                associated healthcare
                                providers could save €6.5-9.1 million per country per annum<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a
                                        href="cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>.This
                                shows that the
                                commission, who have a desire to both save lives and reduce costs, would certainly
                                bulk purchase our tests.
                            </p>
                            <p>Eg: The EU purchased 500 million vaccine doses (Astro Zeneca)with the price being between
                                £3 and £4, total price mounted
                                to about 1.75 billion pounds- 2021<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a
                                        href="cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>.</p>
                            <h3>Key partners and advertising if our kit was to be implemented</h3>
                            <p>To maximise efficiency of our kit production, we must partner up with other companies to
                                purchase supplies and
                                equipment.</p>
                            <p>Toeholds and probe production will require advice and purchases from gene-specialist
                                companies such as IDT.</p>
                            <p>Other medical-equipment companies, for example needles to take blood samples, may be
                                supplied from companies like BD.</p>
                            <p>To promote the purchase of the product, we will have to focus on advertisements. When
                                advertising medical products, it
                                is extremely important to scrutinise its effect on the people who come in contact with
                                the adverts. They must not induce
                                fear or provide false/exaggerated information.</p>
                            <p>If implemented, the promotion team must research further into laws and regulations around
                                medical equipment and
                                detection kits.</p>
                            <h3>Safety</h3>
                            <p>Despite the invasive nature of our kit (blood sampling), when the blood taking is
                                executed without failure of following
                                protocols (eg: sterile needle, disinfect skin before sampling), there should be no
                                direct side effect.</p>
                            <p>When looking at the larger picture, our kits may affect the safety of preeclampsia
                                patients when a false negative is
                                shown. This may be due to a production error, anomalous miRNA regulation in the patient,
                                sampling error, or by pure
                                chance. This is in fact the case with most testing kits, especially rapid, low-cost
                                tests, namedly the COVID-19 lateral
                                flow tests. To mitigate the possibility of infringing the safety of preeclampsia
                                patients, we propose the following
                                measures to be taken:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Clearly state to all customers about the chance of false negatives. An example could
                                    be: <blockquote class="quote-highlight">‘Though our kits provide a
                                        rapid testing tool to screen preeclampsia, it is not deterministic. A positive
                                        result indicates a high possibility of
                                        the testee having preeclampsia. A negative result indicates a high possibility
                                        that
                                        the testee does not have
                                        preeclampsia. When a positive result is obtained, consult a doctor or seek
                                        immediate
                                        medical aid. When a negative result
                                        is obtained, pay attention to potential preeclampsia symptoms, and test again
                                        with a
                                        doctor at the next obstetrician
                                        appointment. This is suggested as false negative results may occur with low
                                        probabilities.’</blockquote>
                                </li>
                                <li>To reduce faulty tests due to contamination, users should be instructed not to
                                    physically contact some areas of the
