            <h2>MASS ACTION KINETICS MODEL</h2>
            <p>With the help of Imperial College’s 2020 Math Modelling paper <sup id="cite_ref-1"><a
                        href="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/9/96/T--Imperial_College--introtomodelling.pdf">[1]</a></sup>,
                we created a mass action kinetics
                model, which models the concentration of our final miRNA-antimiRNA complex relative to time and initial
                miRNA
                concentration.</p>
            <p><i>Initially:</i> to form an miRNA-antimiRNA AND gate complex, we need both the 210-3p and 517-5p miRNAs.
                Whichever miRNA has
                the lowest concentration will be the limiting factor, and hence the concentration of the lesser miRNA is
                considered as
                the concentration of the binding molecule.</p>
            <h3>Assumptions</h3>
            <ol>

                <li>The concentration of miRNA = the concentration of the limiting miRNA</li>
                <ol class="lettered-list">
                    <li>The lesser miRNA is the limiting factor, and hence the excess of the greater miRNA does not have

            <p>Plotting this graph, with [m] on the horizontal axis and [C] on the vertical axis we get a graph looking
                like:</p>
            <img src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/f/f8/T--City_of_London_UK--Modelling_m_against_c.png/800px-T--City_of_London_UK--Modelling_m_against_c.png"
                alt="Graph of [m] against [C]">
            <p>This graph shows the relationship between final complex concentration relative to the initial lesser
                miRNA
                concentration. Beyond the limits shown on this graph, the equations becomes nigh-linear.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Now we go back to our initial steps.</p>
            <p>\[We \ iterated: \frac{d[c]}{dt} \boldsymbol{=k_a[A][m]^2-k_d[C]}\]</p>
            <p>over time to figure out the complex concentration against time, knowing that \(k_a = 2*10^{-3} \
                mol^{-1}s^{-1}\) and \(k_d\) is assumed to be half of \(k_a\).</p>
            <p>The purpose of this step was to identify at which point in time the concentrations of the complexes
                significantly
                differed between preeclampsia patients and unaffected people.</p>
            <p>From our preliminary project research, we found out that the miRNAs in preeclampsia patients were
                upregulated by 4 fold.
                With this information, we produced two graphs, one of which had quadruple the concentration of miRNA of
                the other, ie:
                0.1M and 0.4M.</p>
            <p>In addition, we did not set our anti miRNA concentration to double the miRNA concentration as we wanted
                to keep the
                miRNA concentrations as our only independent variable. Therefore, we set anti miRNA concentration to an
                excess of 2M
                instead of 0.2M and 0.8M respectively.</p>

            <p>As can be seen from the graphs, it was actually the case that at quadruple the concentration of miRNA,
                the complex
                concentrations rapidly diverged between the two samples, almost within seconds of iteration. Both took
                the same amount
                of time to reach equilibrium (ie. time taken to plateau). At 5000s past zero, the concentrations of the
                two samples
                differed by 15 times, which was definitely significant enough to cover all errors due to toehold
                leakiness, human error,
                and other environmental factors.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Improvement on BATMAN 2017</h2>
            <p>Now using our AND gate model, we can substitute our calculated complex concentration as ‘miRNA’ on
                BATMAN’s model.</p>
            <p>To figure out Firefly luciferase luminescence instead of GFP expression, the next step would only require
                the
                substitution of 2 rates: the transcription and translation rates of luciferase instead of GFP.</p>
            <p>Once the substitution is done, our model and the BATMAN’s Mass Action Kinetics Model can be combined to
                provide future
                researchers and teams a tool to predict reporter gene expression relative to initial limiting miRNA
                concentration in a
                single Toehold Switch system involving multiple miRNAs in an AND gate.</p>

                    The specificity follows a different pattern, as the temperature increases the specificity decreases.
                    Between 0 and 40
                    degrees a strong ~80% specificity was detected. After that, there is a decrease in the specificity.
                    This switch was
                    designed to operate at 30 degrees and this data supports this as a possible optimum temperature.
                    This data point has the
                    greatest activation percentage for all points that have a ~80% specificity.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>This dissatisfactory switch had a low activation percentage (~0%) and low specificity (~10%)
                    for all points between 0
                    and 40 degrees. After this, both measures rose sharply and an activation percentage of over 50% was
                    recorded past 80
                    degrees. The specificity also rose sharply with an ~80% value achieved at 60 degrees before dropping
                    again. At 60
                    degrees the switch has an activation of 38% and a high specificity. This would make it the ideal
                    temperature to operate
                    at. However, it is not feasible to run a simple test at such a high temperature. This, along with
                    Professor Green’s
                    recommendation is the reason why our first generation switches were replaced by our second

                <figcaption>The activation of this switch is much higher than the first generation switch. This has a
                    steady high activation around
                    65% for temperatures 0-60 degrees. After these temperatures, the activation drops towards 30%. As
                    worried, this series
                    of switches would be less specific due to the lack of an anti-miRNA and here, the specificity at 30
                    and 40 degrees is a
                    much lower 20% compared to the 80% in the first generation. The specificity increases between 10 and
                    70 degrees,
                    eventually peaking above 40%. In practice, this lower specificity is still good enough to provide
                    reliable positive
                    tests especially when this toehold switch is combined with our RPA methods which amplifies the

                <figcaption>This switch performs superbly in these software tests, especially in comparison to it’s
                    first generation counterpart. At
                    0 degrees the activation percentage is ~40% and this figure rises to a wide peak at 40 degrees with
                    an activation of
                    ~70%. By 70 degrees the activation percentage is 40% before reaching 0 at 80 and 90 degrees. The
                    activation of this
                    switch is above 80% between 0 and 70 degrees before dropping to 0% at 80 degrees. This switch was
                    designed to operate at
                    a temperature of 37 degrees, which explains why this switch peaks in activation at 40 degrees. This
                    switch can
                    accurately perform their task at temperatures lower than body temperature which makes practical use

            <h2>The calculations:</h2>
            <p>Births in the UK in 2019 were 712,0001<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_ref-5">[5]</a></sup></p>
            <p>6% of total pregnancies suffer from preeclampsia<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_ref-6">[6]</a></sup>
                \(= 712,000 * 0.06 = 42720 \) </p>
            <p>Since in multiple studies there was high upregulation of the specific miRNAs we are testing for, we will
                assume the
                sensitivity to be 100%, meaning everybody who has preeclampsia will test positive. While false positives
                will obviously
                arise since the cost of the treatment is quite low in terms of the extra medication and the like we can
                ignore these
                since we have no concrete figures on the false positive rate anyway.</p>
            <p>Thus, assuming we identify every one and use the range of treatments possible (and assume that the lowest
                bound of
                people are treated), we can prevent around 60% of preeclampsia cases, and assuming the same proportion
                of serious
                complications are also prevented will be assumed.<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a

            <p>In regard to the study about the incidence rate of complications in pre-eclampsia - the overall
                preeclampsia rate was
                around 6% in this study which backs up the NHS’ figure of around 6%. The study was also done in Scotland
                which is great
                since it's the UK. While the data is a bit dated, the incidence of certain conditions given preeclampsia
                shouldn’t
                change much since we haven’t really become much better at predicting and treating preeclampsia since
                2000.</p>
