            <p>It has been previously shown that students who use practical work to augment their learning rather than
                relying on lectures achieve significantly higher results, hence suggesting that knowledge retention is
                greatly improved by doing practical work involving that knowledge<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a
                        href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>. This is the reason why an experiment involving DNA
                extraction, in tandem with a powerpoint presentation on the subject, was used by us to introduce younger
                students to the concepts of DNA, its structure and function. This was later followed by a lesson
                building on the students’ knowledge of DNA by teaching them the basics of what synthetic biology is and
                its many uses. This combination of lessons helped to secure both fundamental and more advanced
                knowledge, which may fuel the students’ interest in learning further about synthetic biology themselves.
            </p>
            <p>Additional materials for optional further study have been provided as part of the lessons.</p>

            <p>Our target audience is children of ages 10-13, and it is likely that the materials provided by us, such
                as the
                powerpoint and lesson, will be used to generate an interest in DNA, genetics and synthetic biology, all
                of which may
                lead to them learning more about synthetic biology and its applications to further their own interest,
                which was
                generated by this lesson.</p>

            <p>Through interviewing <mark class="">Mrs J. Brown</mark>, headmistress at City of London School for Girls
                and a previous patient of
                preeclampsia, we were able to hear a firsthand insight into her experiences with the disease.</p>
            <p>We then moulded our project to be able to reflect her views on what it is like to suffer from it and how
                she would have
                liked to have known more about preeclampsia before her pregnancy. This inspired us to create
                informational leaflets on
                the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, placing them around areas in our community to educate the public.
                We also then made
                a podcast from our interview with Mrs J. Brown which allowed us to reach broader audiences to convey an
                extremely
                personal experience, hopefully helping other people who have the complication or who want to know more
                about
                preeclampsia. Publishing the podcast series on spotify allows a huge range of audiences to be able to
                listen and be
                educated on the many topics we cover, from the pathology of the disease to how charities are reaching
                out to sufferers
                in countries all over the world.</p>

            <p>The podcast included an interview with Dr Andrew Shennan, Professor of Obstetrics at King’s College
                London who concluded
                with the importance of raising the public’s awareness of the disease.</p>
            <p>We believed that one of the places to start tackling the problem of the disease was educating people
                about preeclampsia,
                the biology behind it, symptoms, what the current detection mechanism is and what the treatment is.
                Therefore, we made a
                leaflet with all the relevant information regarding the disease to spread awareness.</p>

            <p>Through speaking to a number of medical professionals and a previous sufferer of pre-eclampsia, it became
                clear to us
                that the maternal condition and it’s life-threatening potential is often underreported and undisclosed.
                Hence, we
                decided to create our very own Pre-eclampsia app to tackle this problem head-on and raise the public’s
                awareness of the
                condition. In our app, we explain to users what exactly preeclampsia is, when it occurs as well as how
                our team is
                trying to improve maternal healthcare through our project. We have also incorporated a live feed of
                Preeclampsia news
                updates to educate users on current affairs and the latest medical advancements around managing the
                condition and
                eliminating its threat.</p>
