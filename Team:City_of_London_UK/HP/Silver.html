            <p>After initially asking friends and family whether they had heard of Pre-Eclampsia, we quickly realised
                that awareness
                was not as wide-spread as it should be. In order to confirm this, we decided to construct a survey to
                gain a wider
                understanding of the general public’s awareness of Pre-Eclampsia.</p>

            <p>After making the first draft of our survey, it was brought to our attention that there are certain
                ethical and social
                values that we must keep in mind, as Pre-Eclampsia can be a very personal topic for some people and it
                is very important
                for us to be respectful and not cause any harm to the participants.</p>
            <p>This led us to speak to numerous people on the iGEM Ethics Committee, including the Committee Chair of
                Inclusivity and
                Diversity, so that we felt confident that our survey was appropriate, whilst keeping it unbiased. This
                was a very useful
                experience as they gave us many useful tips (sum of which can be seen on the Integrated Human Practices
                document) which
                helped us learn about how to conduct surveys that encompass values whilst providing us with reliable
                results.</p>

            <p>We wanted to find out what information about Pre-Eclampsia already exists, so we looked at a survey from
                2015 which
                includes responses from 1500 people in the US.<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
                The results highlighted that despite many of the
                respondents having heard
                of Pre-Eclampsia, more than half did not know any associated symptoms and that Pre-Eclampsia can occur
                up to six weeks
                after delivery. This quickly showed us that education about this topic must become more wide-spread.</p>
            <p>Despite this information already existing, our survey will mainly have participants from the UK, and
                therefore it will
                be interesting to see if there has been a comparative increase or decrease in awareness. As well as
                this, our main
                audience are 16-19 year olds who are supposedly the next generation to potentially become pregnant.
                Therefore, we
                thought our survey would be helpful in highlighting differences in education.</p>
            <p>However, unfortunately the nearly 150 responses from 16-19 year olds made it evident that more education
                is needed.</p>
            <p>Our project focuses on creating an effective yet affordable detection kit. Our focus on its affordability
                is as a result
                of extensive moral and social consideration: we want to ensure that our kit can reach the entirety of
                society, as well
                as both low and high income countries worldwide<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a
                        href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup>. This is especially important to us as 99% of women who die
                from
                pregnancy related causes are in low and middle income countries. In engaging with healthcare, we believe
                that we have a
                responsibility not to contribute to health inequality, instead working to actively combat it. The aims
                of our project
                sit firmly alongside ‘The Millennium Development Goals’<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a
                        href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>, which have placed maternal health at the core of the struggle
                against poverty and inequality, as a matter of human rights. We believe that its affordability allows
                for it to be
                implemented into routine use by the NHS, a comprehensive service, which is by definition available to
                all.</p>
            <p>Through our varied research, public surveys and outreach work, we have found that general awareness of
                preeclampsia is
                low. Therefore a key aim of our project became raising awareness of preeclampsia so that the 4.6% of
                pregnant women
                affected worldwide<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>, are more likely to
                recognise early signs and receive effective treatment. This work in increasing
                awareness of the condition has significant social benefits through ultimately preserving lives as more
                effective
                treatment can be accessed earlier following the onset of the disease. This is key as the Preeclampsia
                Foundation have
                concluded that 60% of maternal deaths due to preeclampsia are preventable<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a
                        href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>. Our project hopes to reduce the likelihood of
                lasting impacts for both the mother and developing fetus.</p>
            <p>When designing our project we specifically wanted to make an early and accurate test for preeclampsia in
                order to reduce
                the severity of the symptoms as well as increase the chance of survival for the mother and baby.
                Preeclampsia concerns
                the partial transformation of spiral arteries, leading to more vasoconstriction and reduced placental
                perfusion<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>. With an
                early detection system followed by the use of mitigating treatments like labetalol/anticonvulsant
                medication and
                increased rest for the mother, our project aims to limit the danger and onset of hypertension,
                convulsions, and fetal
                hypoxia<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
            <p>Following the construction of our biological circuits to detect upregulated miRNA during Preeclampsia,
                our next step was
                to confirm the viability of the project and therefore its social value to the world. In doing so, we
                contacted the
                Preeclampsia Foundation, explaining our project and its core principle. After liaising with the <mark
                    class="quote-highlight"> Managing Director at the
                    Charity, Valerie Holloway</mark>, we received an official letter from the charity, which stresses
                that Preeclampsia is a
                ‘real-world problem’ caused by a combination of misdiagnoses and missed diagnoses, and recognises the
                potential of our
                project concept to improve healthcare outcomes and ‘certainly contribute to reducing mortality’.</p>

            <p>To ensure our project’s innovation, we interviewed Professor Basky Thilaganathan, Clinical Director of
                Fetal Medicine at
                St George’s Hospital. In doing so, Thilaganathan stressed the significance of an early detection tool,
                stating that it
                is ‘absolutely vital’, and that current methods ‘[rely] on a two-hundred-year-old instrument’ for
                detection. He also
                highlighted our RNA test’s potential economic benefits through preventative measures; early detection
                can reduce the
                number of Preeclampsia patients with several responses, which in turn would lower the costs required for
                treatment of
                these cases. Additionally, consulting Professor Thilaganathan advanced our understanding of
                Preeclampsia, as he
                highlighted a new-hypothesis which we were previously unaware of: the relation between pre-eclampsia and
                the heart, and
                how calcium, statins, metformin and aspirin, which are all used to treat pre-eclampsia, are all used to
                treat
                cardiovascular disease. In the 2020, Professor Thilaganathan, along with other Preeclampsia specialists,
                designed a
                programme which reduced the cases of Preeclampsia at St George’s by 25%<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a
                        href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>. It is for this reason that we consider him a
                credible source, from which we could accurately judge our project’s use in a clinical setting.</p>

            <p>In our interview with Professor Lucy Chappell, NIHR research professor in obstetrics at King’s College
                London, we were
                able to explore the current methods of screening and detection whilst also analysing the benefits of our
                proposed
                system. Chappell introduced the importance of screening methods at 12 weeks, talking about the use of
                ‘clinical history
                such as body mass index and diseases like pre-existing hypertension’ and how if you have certain
                combinations of risk
                factors you are offered aspirin which ‘reduces the risk of getting preeclampsia by 50%’. She accentuated
                how the
                inherent problems with screening and detection methods is its sensitivity and specificity and therefore
                there needs to
                be a ‘trade-off’ between the two. When examining our proposed test, Chappell commented that whilst it
                would be
                ‘beneficial for developing countries’ one must remember that there is a ‘much lower incentive for the
                diagnostics
                companies to pursue’ these tests where they would ‘struggle’ to sell the tests for an economically
                suitable price.
                Additionally, Chappell found the And Switch useful as using both RNAs would ‘reduce false negatives’- an
                example of
                favouring specificity over sensitivity. Professor Lucy Chappell was the Honorary Research Director of
                the Action on
                Pre-eclampsia Charity and therefore is a reliable source of information on the issue of Pre-eclampsia.

            <p>Throughout our Project, we have relied on the help and advice of specialists and the public to help craft
                different
                aspects of our project - from the Design, to the Model, to Human Practices.</p>
            <p>This page outlines interactions with different groups of people and individuals, and how their feedback
                was integrated
                into our project.</p>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <h3>Dr. Bae Wooli</h3>
            <figure class="diagram-with-p hardware-figure">

            </figure>
            <p>Meetings with Dr Wooli helped the design team resolve some initial questions we had. In the
                meeting with Dr Wooli where
                we discussed using Anti miRNA instead of a normal toehold switch which we were using in our gen1
                switches, he advised us
                to not use an anti miRNA design as he could not see how it would increase specificity.</p>
            <p>Dr Wooli also advised us on ensuring the hybridisation domain length was more than 10
                nucleotides long, so we increased
                the hybridisation domain of our AND gate switch, which previously had lower domain lengths for
                each
                trigger miRNA.</p>
            <p>He also advised us to look at more than just the Minimum Free Energy (MFE) structure of our toehold
                switch-miRNA
                complex, but rather the 20 most likely secondary structures. We took this into consideration when
                writing the python
                script to design the gen2 toehold switches, by using probabilistic sampling, rather than just looking at
                the MFE
                structure.</p>
            <p>Finally, he advised us against preparing our own cell lysate to use as a cell-free system in the lab, but
                to look into
                TXTL kits. We took this into account and ended up using a TXTL kit in the lab on his recommendation.</p>
            <h3>Professor Basky Thilaganathan</h3>
            <figure class="diagram-with-p hardware-figure">

                    alt="Dr. Bae Wooli">
            </figure>
            <p>We were wary after we found out from Professor Basky that preeclampsia’s origin, despite this often being
                overlooked,
                lies within the heart as opposed to the placenta; this could mean the miRNAs which are upregulated in
                patients with
                Preeclampsia may not be present in high levels in patients with other heart problems. So we made sure to
                check on
                miRBase and a number of other miRNA databases that our microRNA biomarkers were not also upregulated in
                those
                conditions. Professor Basky also agreed that detecting a cocktail of miRNAs as opposed to just one,
                would allow us to
                create a more specific test. This inspired us to create our AND-gate switch.</p>
            <h3>Dr Alex Green</h3>
            <figure class="diagram-with-p hardware-figure">
                <img src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/a/a4/T--City_of_London_UK--IHP_AGREEN.png"
                    alt="Dr Alex Green">
            </figure>
            <p>Dr Green is an expert in toehold switches, and synthetic biology in general. He advised us to base parts
                of our switches
                - notably the RBS - on his design for Zika virus detection, so we based all of our switches on these.
            </p>
            <p>He agreed with Dr Wooli that we should not use our gen1 switch, as it would not increase specificity, but
                could in fact
                have the opposite effect by decreasing the length of the hybridisation domain, so we discarded these
                designs and he
                confirmed that our gen2 and gen3 switches should work.</p>
            <p>We asked him about whether we could vary our linker regions from his design, as we had previously kept
                the amino acid
                sequence the same by only varying codons which limited our design capability. He told us that we could
                change the linker
                sequence and it wouldn’t have much effect on the switch’s performance, which allowed us to tweak our
                design algorithm
                for our gen2 switches, and gave us more freedom in designing our gen3 switch.</p>
            <figure class="diagram-with-p hardware-figure">
                <img src="https://2021.igem.org/wiki/images/thumb/3/33/T--City_of_London_UK--IHP_AGREEN2.png/800px-T--City_of_London_UK--IHP_AGREEN2.png"
                    alt="Dr Alex Green">
            </figure>
            <p>Furthermore, we asked him about how we could ensure our gen3 ‘AND-gate’ switch would unfold, and he
                suggested we look to
                vary the stem length. By doing this, we were able to ensure it unfolded properly on Nupack.</p>
            <p>We later reached out to Dr Green about whether amplification would be necessary and he confirmed that in
                the real world,
                amplification might well be necessary. Based on his comments, we started researching an isothermal
                amplification
                strategy.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>After speaking with Professor Green about the necessity of amplification, we spoke to Dr O’Sullivan, a
                highly accredited
                biochemist working on amplification methods for nucleic acids among other projects.
            </p>
            <p>We had decided that we’d like to isothermally amplify our miRNAs to ensure expensive equipment isn’t
                necessary for our
                test to be used, increasing its accessibility. We had noticed, however, that no other teams that had
                looked into toehold
                switches had researched amplification methods, let alone isothermal methods.</p>
            <p>Dr O’Sullivan was impressed by our project and agreed with our assumption that the best way for us to
                amplify the miRNAs
                would be to first anneal two probes to them which would then be ligated together (this is called
                miRPA).We were looking
                for a method to amplify the miRNA, but she explained that there weren’t any currently researched methods
                which would
                result in amplified miRNA, but rather DNA based on an miRNA template. However, she told us that she
                thought single
                stranded DNA (ssDNA) would also be able to activate our toehold switch. Based on this advice, we looked
                into ways of
                getting the dsDNA from miRPA to become ssDNA, eventually settling on asymmetric RPA.</p>

            <p>Speaking to Professor Lucy Chappell, a research professor at King’s College London in Obstetrics, made us
                aware of how
                our project could have a great impact on third world countries. In our interview, she explained how by
                reducing the
                costs of the screening tool, our detection kit will be more appropriate in a global setting and could
                have a greater
                impact in these less economically developed countries, where access to even basic medical care is
                limited. With this in
                mind, we tried to make our hardware design as cost-effective as possible, by making it reusable and by
                developing our
                own luminometer. These changes, together with our removal of the automated liquid addition system, have
                significantly
                reduced the costs of our screening tool which we now hope will have a much wider impact across the
                globe.</p>

            <p>Meeting with KCL helped us further consider how to avoid possible implications of our project as well as
                the ethical and
                data protection laws that need to be followed. They advised us to run our surveys by iGEM to ensure we
                remained ethical.
                Furthermore, they helped amend the phrasing of letters and surveys we were sending out to this end.</p>

            <p>Anne Meyer, the committee chair of diversity and inclusivity from the Meyer Lab further, advised us on
                the importance of
                confidentiality with our data collection, and ways in which we can ensure this. We also discussed the
                importance of
                using gender inclusive language in our Survey with her. We decided, based on the discussion, to not talk
                about
                preeclampsia affecting ‘pregnant women’, but rather ‘pregnant patients’. And made sure to not make any
                type of analysis
                that could be perceived as a diagnosis.</p>

            <p>Contacting John Gray from the iGEM human practices committee also gave us advice on narrowing down
                distribution and
                designing scientifically valid surveys. He also informed us that our survey must be IRB approved.
                Furthermore, he
                advised us to try talking to clinicians about the condition. We took this feedback into consideration,
                and arranged to
                talk to Professor Lucy Chappell, Professor Basky Thilaganathan, and Dr Andew Shennan. We decided to
                prioritise
                increasing public awareness on preeclampsia with our human practices research for our project. Emailing
                Tessa Alexanian,
                a safety and security program officer with the iGEM foundation helped us gain insight into how to go
                about educating
                others on this. She proposed starting with existing research from preeclampsia related foundations based
                in the UK and
                other more specific regions. We then decided to consider what additional knowledge we were hoping to
                gain from our
                survey and designed our sampling strategy around that.</p>

            <p>Our interview with Dr Andrew Shennan made us realise the current lack of awareness of Preeclampsia and
                how tackling the
                prenatal disease requires public education as well as scientific solutions. This point was further
                reinforced when
                speaking with Mrs J. Brown, the current headmistress at City of London School for Girls and a previous
                patient of
                preeclampsia, who would have liked to have known more about preeclampsia before her pregnancy. Having
                heard a personal
                experience and also from a scientific expert, we were determined to raise the public’s awareness of the
                disease. In
                doing so, we created leaflets detailing what Preeclampsia is, and relevant medical information about the
                disease.</p>
            <h3>The Preeclampsia Foundation</h3>
            <p>Choosing our project was the culmination of months of deliberation as, even though we had several choices
                to select
                from, we were not sure which of these societal issues were real-world problems that could benefit from
                our solution. To
                decide, we reached out to several charities, amongst them Preeclampsia Foundation, who responded and
                reassured us that
                Preeclampsia is a ‘real world problem’ and that our project had the potential to make a huge impact and
                could ‘certainly
                contribute to reducing mortality’.</p>
