            <h1 class="main-header">Safety</h1>
            <p>Any piece of work, especially a biological project involving lab work and coming with the future possible
                implementations in a medical setting, comes with a considerable amount of risk. We have worked
                diligently to ensure that
                these risks are reduced considerably, not only for the sake of the iGem regulations and local laws, but
                also for the
                sake of ensuring our own safety and aligning with common ethical courtesy. We have applied stringent
                risk reducing
                regulations to our laboratory work, hardware and explored the possible safety measures required for our
                future
                implementation.</p>

            <h2>Wet Lab</h2>
            <p>The live bacteria that we are using are E. Coli JM109 of the K-12 family. They are in risk group 1 and
                present no risk
                to humans as they lack certain genes necessary for pathogenic characteristics<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a
                        href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>. The
                characterisation of our toehold switch constructs took place in a TXTL cell-free kit. This has little
                risk and so may be
                safely used outside the lab as a convenient diagnostic tool. Our isothermal amplification also requires
                no living
                organisms. We used an RPA kit which is not a biohazard and may be used outside of the lab. However, we
                kept all of our
                kit within the safer confines of our laboratory.</p>
            <p>Instead of using human plasma samples to test our genetic constructs, we used oligos which we ordered off
                of IDT. This
                reduces the need to have unnecessary biohazardous human samples.</p>
            <p>As a secondary school team we had further school regulations to follow but we were also given the
                opportunity to learn
                safety techniques through the syllabus.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lab access and rules. All labs are locked when out of use and can only be accessed by a responsible
                    teacher with a
                    masterkey. When not in use, our equipment and biological materials are kept in a locked technicians
                    room. We abided by
                    the school laboratory rules and regulations which include a prohibition of eating, drinking, running
                    and throwing. Our
                    microbiology lab and technicians room were clearly signposted so that all persons that were in the
                    vicinity understood
                    the dangers of the area.</li>
                <li>Responsible individuals. We all understood that any safety queries and issues should be reported to
                    the technician or PI
                    who were always in the lab supervising us.</li>
                <li>Good microbial technique. We wore microbiology lab-coats at all times as well as wearing gloves, eye
                    protection,
                    trousers and hard, closed footwear. We placed all waste in autoclave bags, with these autoclaved
                    before disposal. All
                    micropipette tips were released directly into virkon which was replaced when the disinfectant was
                    cloudy. Our plates
                    were incubated below human body temperature and were given aerobic conditions.</li>
                <li>Disinfection and sterilization. We disinfected our work areas with virkon (as opposed to ethanol
                    which is deemed a fire
                    risk) and had the disinfectant close to our work areas. We worked on clean lab mats on top of the
                    lab benches and had a
                    bunsen burner on for sterilization of the environment and equipment.</li>
                <li>Chemical, electrical and fire safety. We all received training and advice on the interpretation of
                    the warning signs on
                    each chemical and how to use them safely. Protocols and an eye wash kit were in place in case of an
                    emergency. There was
                    a kill switch for all electrical appliances in the room and all members of the team understood the
                    school's fire
                    evacuation procedures.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>All hardware work was done under teacher supervision. The work that we did also had several safety
                features, for
                example, the electromagnets were separated from the solution compartment. On top of that, the
                contraption comes with a
                lid. Furthermore, waterproof wiring was used throughout the project. We further mitigated the risk of
                sparks and fire by
                working in a laboratory with a fire extinguisher nearby.</p>
            <h3>Future Implementation</h3>
            <p>As with any test, there is a chance of a misdiagnosis through false positives or false negatives. This is
                not a risk
                unique to our test and so will be mitigated in the common manner of running additional tests.</p>
            <p>We will also be taking a blood sample, which although is not uncommon nor dangerous still comes with
                risks. Some people
                feel dizzy during and after the test<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>.</p>
