                <h1>Teams</h1>
                <ul>

                </ul>
                <h3>Biology Team</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Researched and identified two miRNA biomarkers
                        upregulated in
                        patients with Preeclampsia at 10 weeks, twice as soon as current methods allow.
                    </li>
                    <li>Designed and characterised two design generations of
                        toehold
                        switches, including a novel AND-gate switch.</li>
                    <li>Designed a method for amplifying miR-210-3p and
                        miR-517-5p
                        isothermally.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Hardware Team</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designed and assembled a luminometer. Designed a
                        magnetic
                        bead-based miRNA extraction system.</li>
                    <li>The designed hardware utilises a luciferase assay to
                        determine
                        the result of our preeclampsia detection tests.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Software Team</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><mark>Developed ToeholdTools</mark>, which contains
                        an
                        easy-to-use programmatic API for investigating the target RNA specificity of toehold
                        switches.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Modelling Team</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Using Hill-Langmuir equations, the Modelling Team
                        developed a
                        Mass Action Kinetics model to predict complex formation.</li>
                    <li>NUPACK and cost models were also developed to build
                        on software
                        and implementation aspects of the project.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Human Practice Team</h3>

                        improve our
                        project.</li>
                    <li>Conducted surveys to collect data and understand
                        methods to
                        raise awareness about preeclampsia.</li>
                    <li>Delivered lessons to younger years to teach about
                        DNA, genetics,
                        and synthetic biology.</li>
                    <li>Created leaflets and developed an app to update
                        people about the
                        latest preeclampsia news.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Finance Team </h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Delivering project presentations and proposals to
                        potential

                <h2>BIOLOGY TECHNICIANS</h2>
                <h3>Mrs Waite</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mrs Waite took a pivotal role in our project.
                        Without her help
                        in preparing our wet lab equipment, project RIBOTOX would not have existed. We pay
                        immense gratitude
                        for all the time she spent both during term time and the holidays to assist our iGEM
                        team.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Ms Tasnim</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ms Tasnim was crucial in the latter phase of our lab
                        work.
                        Despite the chaotic nature of our term-time lab work, our team managed to hold balance
                        thanks to her
                        involvement. Her unparalleled speed and accuracy in producing buffers and gels were
                        instrumental in
                        the successful completion of our lab work.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>ADDITIONAL TEACHER SUPPORT</h2>

                        also thank her
                        for lending her sacred incubator.</li>
                </ul>

                        and knowledge
                        in Synthetic Biology proved to be invaluable during our lab planning and troubleshooting
                        phases. As
                        the gaffer of the triumphant 2017 BATMAN team, he was a true role model for our
                        team.</li>
