----

This switch was designed to detect the miRNA hsa-miR-210-3p at a temperature of 37.
We tested it against every <i>Homo sapiens</i> RNA in miRBase and our analysis shows that it is best used to detect hsa-miR-10392-5p.

With hsa-miR-10392-5p at 37°C, the switch has a specificity of 15 ± 200 % and an activation of 13 ± 5 %.
These values represent 95% confidence limits (z=1.96).

The temperature&ndash;activation&ndash;specificity relationship is shown here:

Error bars represent the standard error (SE).
The line of best fit was calculated using a univariate cubic spline weighted inverse to each point's SE.

'''Caveats:'''
*As per the above, we cannot confirm that this switch detects the desired RNA sequence.
*Although at the indented usage temperature of {celsius}°C this switch best detected {inferred_target_name}, this RNA did not appear as a best target for any of separate tests taken at the temperatures tested in the above graph ({temperature_range}). Therefore, we cannot confirm the reliability of this switch. 

We do not recommend this part for future usage.
