This switch was designed to detect the miRNA hsa-miR-517-5p at a temperature of 37.
We tested it against every <i>Homo sapiens</i> RNA in miRBase and our analysis shows that it is best used to detect hsa-miR-517-5p.

With hsa-miR-517-5p at 37°C, the switch has a specificity of 19 ± 20 % and an activation of 149 ± 8 %.
These values represent 95% confidence limits (z=1.96).

The temperature&ndash;activation&ndash;specificity relationship is shown here:

Error bars represent the standard error (SE).
The line of best fit was calculated using a univariate cubic spline weighted inverse to each point's SE.
