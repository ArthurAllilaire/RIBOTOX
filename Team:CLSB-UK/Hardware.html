            <h3>Building a cheap luminometer</h3>
            <p>Building on the ideas submitted by Team BATMAN in 2017, we have not only developed a cheap, effective and
                easily
                portable luminometer but also a viable method of miRNA extraction using biotinylated magnetic beads.</p>
            <p>We aim to make this a reliable and readily available test for pre-eclampsia in hospitals and GP
                surgeries.</p>
            <p>Our primary focus in Hardware was price- by building our own luminometer into the device, we ensured that
                this test is
                much more accessible especially in rural areas and less developed countries.</p>
            <p>In addition to price, our focus was also simplicity. We initially considered a completely automated
                system that would
                carry out the entire reaction by itself by automatically dispensing, stirring and removing liquids from
                the mixture.
                However, we quickly realised that this was unnecessarily complex and that simplifying the design would
                drastically
                reduce the number of points of failure; making it much more durable long-term.</p>
            <p>Making the device reusable also helped make this device much more environmentally friendly than a
                disposable kit- we’re
                sure there's more than enough plastic waste sitting around right now! In addition to reducing the
                environmental impact,
                this also allows us to reduce the price per individual test.</p>

                <figcaption>Samples of blood taken from the patient are added to the initial compartment containing a
                    solution of
                    magnetic beads.
                    Four Electromagnets are turned on and off in succession to spin the beads around the solution (hence
                    stirring the
                    solution), to increase homogeneity of the concentration of the blood miRNA and the magnetic beads.
                    The
                    magnetic beads
                    are pre-prepared with antiRNA strands, complementary to the target miRNAs, immobilised to the beads
                    (by
                    a strong
                    Biotin-Streptavidin bond), to which the target miRNAs bind by base pairing.</figcaption>

                <figcaption>These magnetic beads are then pulled to the side of the compartment and the rest of the
                    liquid is removed, thus
                    extracting the mRNA. This is repeated 3 times (on the removed liquid) to maximise miRNA captured.
                    This extracts all
                    mRNA, including miRNA, which are present in the blood. An elution buffer is then used to unbind the
                    mRNA from the
                    magnetic beads.</figcaption>

            </figure>
            <p>The extracted miRNA, in solution, is then amplified isothermally using RPA, to amplify the final result
                in order to
                increase precision and make differentiating between positive and negative results easier by amplifying
                the difference in
                concentration that needs to be detected.</p>
            <p>The amplified miRNA is then added to the second compartment which contains our toehold switches, cell
                free translation
                mix and luciferin. The miRNAs bind to the toehold switches, activating them and, hence, triggering the
                translation of
                luciferase, which is coded for by the CDS of our toehold switches. The produced luciferase acts on
                luciferin producing
                light, which we detect using our self-designed luminometer, which is built into this compartment.</p>

            <h2>Detection:</h2>
            <p>Our hardware utilises a luciferase assay to determine the result of our test. Luciferase is an enzyme
                produced by
                fireflies and other bioluminescent organisms. It produces light by acting on luciferin, a relatively
                simple compound.
                When luciferase acts on luciferin, it combines oxygen with luciferin, to produce oxyluciferin in an
                excited state. When
                the single excited electron in the oxyluciferin molecule returns to its ground state, it releases a
                photon of light of
                wavelength of approximately 550-570nm.</p>
            <!-- Animation here -->
            <p>The CDS of our toehold switches codes for luciferase, so when they are activated by the target miRNAs,
                luciferase is
                produced, which acts on the luciferin present in the solution, releasing light. We detect this released
                light using the
                arduino-based luminometer we designed. Our amplification technique, RPA, amplifies the miRNA linearly so
                the light
                released is approximately proportional to the concentration of miRNA of the blood, and the output of the
                LDR used in the
                luminometer is proportional to the irradiance. We use this to program a model that calculates the
                concentration of miRNA
                present in the blood sample and return a positive or negative result for pre-eclampsia by testing it
                against threshold
                values.</p>
            <h2>miRNA extraction and amplification:</h2>
            <p>The concentration of our target miRNA in the blood is very low, making it difficult to amplify without
                prior extraction.
                Keeping in mind cost and accessibility, which are the main goals of our hardware, we quickly realised
                that we would not
                be able to use PCR for extraction, and set out to find a cheap and simple alternative.</p>
            <p>After extensive research we came across a method of miRNA extraction which utilises magnetic
                nanoparticles. Magnetic
                particles coated with bio polymers which exhibit high affinity to total RNA are commonly used to RNA
                extraction, but due
                to the small size of miRNAs, these methods are not effective at extracting miRNA, so the magnetic
                particles need to be
                specially prepared prior to use.</p>
            <p>The magnetic particles are prepared by immobilising antiRNA strands, which are complementary to the
                target miRNAs, to
                the magnetic beads. This is done by first synthesising the antiRNA strands and biotinylating them by
                binding to a
                complementary DNA template and extending by a fill-in reaction using Φ29 DNA Polymerase,the same way any
                DNA Polymerase
                extends an RNA primer in DNA synthesis, but by using biotin-11-dUTP as a substitute for dTTP. These
                biotinylated antiRNA
                strands are then immobilised to the Streptavidin magnetic beads by the strong non-covalent bond formed
                between biotin
                and Streptavidin.</p>
            <!-- Need to add the diagrams -->
            <p>These magnetic beads are added to the blood sample and swirled using 4 programmed electromagnets to
                increase homogeneity
                of magnetic beads concentration for more consistent and efficient binding. The target miRNA strands bind
                to the antiRNA
                strands on the magnetic beads by base pairing, thus binding to the magnetic beads. After a fixed time
                period, the
                electromagnets are switched on to pull the particles to the side of the chamber, and the rest of the
                liquid is removed.
                This process is repeated on the removed liquid 2 to 3 times to maximise the proportion of miRNA
                extracted from the
                sample.</p>
            <!-- Picture of extraction using magnet -->
            <p>To help the toehold switches act and produce strong enough results to quantify with a luminometer, we
                decided to use
                multiple protocols in conjunction to amplify the miRNA. These methods would linearly amplify the
                concentration of miRNA
                of each sample. Due to this linear amplification, ratios of different concentrations of miRNA are
                maintained; allowing
                accurate quantification of concentration within blood. The methods we used were miRPA and Asymmetric
                RPA.</p>
            <p>The former of the methods addresses the fact that miRNA cannot be replicated by the suite of DNA
                replication enzymes. To
                do this, two DNA probes are added to the miRNA. One probe overlaps and overhangs on the 5’ end and the
                other overlaps
                and overhangs on the 3’ end. The 5’ end of the 5’ probe is phosphorylated so that it can be lighted to
                the 3’ end. From
                here, DNA ligase is added. This causes the two probes to bind together; it forms a miRNA complex with
                overhangs on both
                sides. We then add a forward primer to complement the top (overhanging) strand. DNA polymerase extends
                this primer and
                causes a dsDNA complex to be formed with the miRNA replicated within (in DNA form).</p>
            <!-- Simple diagram of miRPA -->
            <p>The next method then replicates the gene fragments of dsDNA formed from miRPA above. Now, forward and
                reverse primers
                are added in order to replicate the double-stranded complex. Recombinase enzymes form new complexes, on
                each side of the
                dsDNA, with both the primers. This allows the dsDNA to be opened and ‘invaded’ by the recombinases. From
                here, the dsDNA
                complex is duplicated; the cycle repeats many times to replicate and amplify the dsDNA. Importantly, we
                added an excess
                of the forward primer. Since this primer causes the miRNA-embedded strand to be replicated, the
                miRNA-embedded strand
                now becomes in excess as well. As such, this strand stays single-stranded and can therefore activate the
                toehold switch.</p>
