        <h1>Luminometer</h1>
        <p>Drawing inspiration from team BATMAN in 2017, we designed and assembled a luminometer to quantify the
            irradiance of
            light emitted from the chemical test, and hence the concentration of the target miRNA present in the
            patientâ€™s blood.
            One of the main reasons behind designing our own luminometer was the fact that standard luminometers cost
            hundreds if
            not thousands of pounds. Requiring this piece of equipment would limit this test to more developed countries
            with much
            more well-endowed clinics, which was completely against our core ideas of accessibility to everyone.</p>
        <p>The main component was the TSL327 light-to-frequency converter, which combined a silicon photodiode with a
            current-to-frequency converter. The output frequency is directly proportional to the intensity of the light
            (irradiance)
            emitted and hence the concentration of target miRNA.</p>
