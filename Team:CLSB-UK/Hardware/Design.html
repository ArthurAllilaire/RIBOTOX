            <figcaption>Samples of blood taken from the patient are added to the initial compartment containing a
                solution of
                magnetic beads.
                Four Electromagnets are turned on and off in succession to spin the beads around the solution (hence
                stirring the
                solution), to increase homogeneity of the concentration of the blood miRNA and the magnetic beads.
                The
                magnetic beads
                are pre-prepared with antiRNA strands, complementary to the target miRNAs, immobilised to the beads
                (by
                a strong
                Biotin-Streptavidin bond), to which the target miRNAs bind by base pairing.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <figure class="diagram-with-p hardware-figure" id="img-under">
            <figcaption>These magnetic beads are then pulled to the side of the compartment and the rest of the
                liquid is removed, thus
                extracting the mRNA. This is repeated 3 times (on the removed liquid) to maximise miRNA captured.
                This extracts all
                mRNA, including miRNA, which are present in the blood. An elution buffer is then used to unbind the
                mRNA from the
                magnetic beads.</figcaption>

                alt="RPA steps">
        </figure>
        <p>The extracted miRNA, in solution, is then amplified isothermally using RPA, to amplify the final result
            in order to
            increase precision and make differentiating between positive and negative results easier by amplifying
            the difference in
            concentration that needs to be detected.</p>
        <p>The amplified miRNA is then added to the second compartment which contains our toehold switches, cell
            free translation
            mix and luciferin. The miRNAs bind to the toehold switches, activating them and, hence, triggering the
            translation of
            luciferase, which is coded for by the CDS of our toehold switches. The produced luciferase acts on
            luciferin producing
            light, which we detect using our self-designed luminometer, which is built into this compartment.</p>
