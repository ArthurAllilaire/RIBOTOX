            <h3>Building a cheap luminometer</h3>
            <p>Building on the ideas submitted by Team BATMAN in 2017, we have not only developed a cheap, effective and
                easily
                portable luminometer but also a viable method of miRNA extraction using biotinylated magnetic beads.</p>
            <p>We aim to make this a reliable and readily available test for pre-eclampsia in hospitals and GP
                surgeries.</p>
            <p>Our primary focus in Hardware was price- by building our own luminometer into the device, we ensured that
                this test is
                much more accessible especially in rural areas and less developed countries.</p>
            <p>In addition to price, our focus was also simplicity. We initially considered a completely automated
                system that would
                carry out the entire reaction by itself by automatically dispensing, stirring and removing liquids from
                the mixture.
                However, we quickly realised that this was unnecessarily complex and that simplifying the design would
                drastically
                reduce the number of points of failure; making it much more durable long-term.</p>
            <p>Making the device reusable also helped make this device much more environmentally friendly than a
                disposable kit- weâ€™re
                sure there's more than enough plastic waste sitting around right now! In addition to reducing the
                environmental impact,
                this also allows us to reduce the price per individual test.</p>
